# Incremental RDF Mapping Language (IncRML)

IncRML combines the [RDF Mapping Language (RML)](https://rml.io/spec) with the [Function Ontology (FnO)](https://fno.io) to detect changes in datasets and incrementally map them into a Knowledge Graph

[Read the spec](https://knowledgeonwebscale.github.io/incrml-spec)

The paper is currently under review at the [Semantic Web Journal](https://semantic-web-journal.net/content/incremental-knowledge-graph-construction-heterogeneous-data-sources).

## Developing

Build the spec using [Bikeshed](https://speced.github.io/bikeshed):
